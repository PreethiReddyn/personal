            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace; color: brown">Majoring in Computer Science</p>
            <p>At Iowa State University, I'm presently working toward an undergraduate degree in computer science. My
                anticipated graduation is in 2025. I commenced my major related educational path at Auburn University,
                where I participated actively in impactful projects and took a variety of computer science related
                courses, such as data structures. One noteworthy project showcased my knowledge of Python and efficient
                teamwork; it involved creating an intricate Graphical User Interface (GUI) where my job was to modify
                the car's temperature before entering. My academic accomplishments, which include consistently making
                the Dean's List, further demonstrate my dedication to excellence. My experiences also go beyond
                academics. I had a job at Auburn University's campus Starbucks. This position not only improved my
                communication skills but also demonstrated my commitment towards inventory management, collaborative
                collaboration, and customer service. I actively participate in the Girls Who Code club at Iowa State
                University, which helps to encourage female students to learn how to code. In addition, I'm refining my
                adaptability, teamwork, and organizing skills as a Catering Server at ISU Catering. Combining my various
                professional experiences with my computer science academic research shows a multifaceted approach to the
                field. My productive attitude and diligent discipline characterize this approach, highlighting my
                dedication to succeeding in the dynamic field of computer science. </p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>

                <div class="project">
                <h3>Project 2</h3>
                <p> Project 2 which was developed at Auburn Universityâ€™s Samuel Ginn College of Engineering, I worked as
                    a developer for the project Auto App, where using python I developed an advanced Graphical User
                    Interface (GUI). I designed this graphical user interface with the specific purpose of enabling
                    users to adjust the car's temperature before getting in. Our team aimed to utilize an app - Auto App
                    to manage different car functions. I successfully incorporated temperature controls, providing users
                    with the capability to use the app for both increasing or decreasing the temperature and toggling
                    the air conditioning on or off without entering the car or through using the app. the essence of our
                    app's success lay significantly in the teamwork we cultivated throughout the project. The team,
                    consisting of four members excluding myself, played a pivotal role in bringing diverse skills and
                    perspectives to the table. We presented our project to our peers, teaching assistants, and
                    professors which was a valuable experience that highlighted the seamless integration of our
                    temperature control feature and other functionalities of the app. This opportunity not only advanced
                    my proficiency in Python but also polished my presentation, teamwork, technical and interpersonal
                    skills.</p>
